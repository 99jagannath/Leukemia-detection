The main task is to classify blood smears by looking at sample pictures of them. This is mainly a computer vision task. The main target is
to surpass the accuracy of 99.2% using various methods.
Henceforth, Plans are to concatenate the feature vector of the pre-trained model (Vgg and ResNet) and use a SVM classifier on it to train the models.
